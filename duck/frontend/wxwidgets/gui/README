The code in this directory was generated using wxFormBuilder version
3.1.68-rc1. The idea is that we subclass the MainWindow class somewhere,
so that we don't touch the generated code, allowing us to modify it inside
wxFormBuilder without affecting the main code, if we don't count widget
renaming and deletion.
