== Duck

A simple musical player for Linux systems. Currently supports an MPD backend
and wxWidgets frontend only. The future plan is to support different backends
and frontends.

== Installation

There isn't a proper installation yet, so you basically just run 'main.py' like this:

$ cd duck && ./main.py

or by explicitly pointing to the interpreter

$ cd duck && /usr/bin/python2 ./main.py

=== System requirements

- Linux OS
- Python 2.6 (version 3 is not yet supported)

=== Dependencies

- wxpython
- python-mpd
- mpd

You should start the mpd server with the default method for starting services
in your distribution.
